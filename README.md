A fully static, mobile-friendly portfolio website hosted on **AWS S3**, fronted by **CloudFront**, and deployed automatically via **GitHub Actions** using OIDC (no AWS secrets required!).

- Hosted on Amazon S3 with HTTPS enabled via CloudFront and ACM
- Auto-deploys on every push to the main branch using GitHub Actions
- Automatically triggers CloudFront cache invalidation only when website files change
- Uses GitHub OIDC for secure, credentials-free authentication during deployment
- Mobile-friendly layout with a responsive sidebar menu

```

## How It Works

1. Push code to `main`
2. GitHub Actions:
   - Assumes an IAM role via OIDC
   - Syncs the site to your S3 bucket
   - Invalidates CloudFront cache
3. Changes go live automatically!
